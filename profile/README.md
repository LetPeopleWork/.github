# Let People Work

## In a time where everyone seems to be busy all the time...
It is getting harder and harder for us to focus on our work. Monotonous interactions and recurring meetings keep us busy as well as distracted from what should be our focus: delivering value to our customers.
As we go on, more meetings are added to rectify the situation, more things are "high-priority" and even less gets done.
The result? Frustrated team members, overwhelmed managers, angry stakeholders, and complaining customers.
People want to contribute. People want to deliver value. People want to be part of something successful. We just need to let them work.
We've seen what impact a change in the system can have on individuals, teams, as well as an organization as a whole.
